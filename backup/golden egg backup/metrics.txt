BTC- USD

start = "2015-01-01"
end = "2025-07-08"

This strategy is my current benchmark and most successful version to date. It delivers:

    Total Return: 17,049 USD

    Profit Factor: 11.01 â€” meaning it earns $11 for every $1 lost

    Win Rate: 61.5%

    Avg Win: 60.91% of entry

    Avg Loss: only -4.21%

    Max Drawdown: just 4.01%

    Works on BTC, ETH, and LTC though LTC behaves okay but not as good. 

It strikes a solid balance between high reward and low risk, with tight losses and the ability to catch massive trend moves.

While not perfect â€” some early buys are small losers â€” the overall equity curve is strong, smooth, and survivable. This version will serve as my performance baseline while I explore stricter entries and better trailing logic.
