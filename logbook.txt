1. entry:
==== ENTRY 2025-06-18 ====
Decision: Removed Heikin-Ashi filter from buy logic.
Reasoning: On visual inspection, Ichimoku trends often span weeks/months while HA candles flip frequently, causing potential missed opportunities.
Evidence: Plot clearly shows multiple HA color changes during strong Ichimoku trend periods.
Assumptions: Ichimoku provides sufficient trend confirmation; HA filter adds noise in this context.
Potential bias: May undervalue HA's micro-timing utility, but willing to simplify for now based on clarity.
Next step: Tune Ichimoku + EMA combo further or test alternate exit logic.
